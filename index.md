I am a PhD student in the Department of Computational Social Sciences, at the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Studies. We focus primarily on neurosciences and applications of complexity theory. This seminar, by Dr. Qin Tian has focused on the question of how seeing policy issues as being framed by the world (human-environment interactions) as a complex adaptive system. ...which is part of what makes good public policy so very difficult to acheive.

## Questions in Context

 - Futurist and strategist in OSD
 - Arms control and weapons proliferation
 - This slide has the hmtl end section and dash amp verticle
 
> Assumptions about the future differ wildly

## Title of first slide with a down arrow

This should be the first slide with a down button

blah, blah

*** 

## Verticle slide under R.I.

I have a few backup slides under the Research Questions slide

***

## Basement Level 1

Press down to navigate.

***

## Basement Level 2

Press up to navigate back up 

But, pressing over works just as well to move to the next slide (over)

*** 

## Basement Level 3

I think it works just as well to go over, even when more slides are below

## Model verification and validation
..* How I would validate such a model

## Experiment design and expected results
..* Some experiments to address the primary questions 
..* What to measure?

## What results did/would you expect? Why?
